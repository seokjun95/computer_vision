# computer_vision

#  1.basic filtering
implement image cross_correlation gaussian_filtering without openCV Library(except make greyscale,print out image)

# 2.image transformation
implement image transformation(x-axis, y-axis, rotate transformation), extract features, matching, with homography

# 3.image classifier(using SIFT feature)
using given SIFT feature, implement classifer which uses machine learning algorithm(K-means, VLAD)
